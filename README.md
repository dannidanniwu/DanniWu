## Hi there üëã

I am Ph.D. candidate at [New York University, Division of Biostatistics](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/) <img src='./NYU_logo.png' style='width: 4em;'>, advised by [Keith Goldfeld](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-s-goldfeld), [Hyung Park](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/hyung-g-park) and [Eva Petkova](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/eva-petkova). 

I graduated from [Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medicine](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/biostatistics-and-data-science), with an M.S. in Biostatistics and Data Science, advised by Samprit Banerjee. Before that, I obtained a B.S. in Applied Statistics from the Central University of Finance and Economics (‰∏≠Â§ÆË¥¢ÁªèÂ§ßÂ≠¶), advised by [Feng Li (Êùé‰∏∞)](http://sam.cufe.edu.cn/info/1115/1876.htm).

I interned at Moderna <img src='./Moderna-Logo.jpg' style='width: 4em;'> in 2023 summer, where I focused on the design of a seamless Phase II/III trial and evaluating surrogate endpoints for early program decisions for their [individualized cancer vaccine](https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/individual.neoantigen-therapies). 

My research interest includes Bayesian Statistics, Precision Medicine, Clinical Trial Design, and Statistical Computing. I have publications in JAMA Internal Medicine, JAMA Network Open, Statistics in Medicine, etc. with a total citations of CITATION_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER.
